# Basic Workflow

[CGCookie](https://cgcookie.com/) basic course is incrediible since t is remade along with Blender major update, but is lenghty.\

Blender is made of various Editor and its shorcuts are based on actual status and where the mouse is resting; the 3D Vieport, Outline(upper right) and Properties(lower right) Editors are the must used ones.\
By default configuration (Right Mouse Button(RMB) and selection and **F3** for Search Tool) you can add objects on 3D Viewport by clicking on the Add Button(**Shift-A**) or searching Tool, many action can be edited by a menu or a respectivre shortcut. Also any shorcut use **Shift** to add more content and **Alt** to reverse it\

You can manipulate the mesh of an object in Edit mode(**Tab** on 3D Viewport) and use **1**, **2**, and **3** to select vertices, edges and faces respecfully; mind that orange dot is the origin point of a object and many action will be based on its position, its better to be at the central or base of an object and can be manipulate via Origin Menu(**Ctrl-Alt-Shift-C**).
Outline list all object on scene based on collection and change its visibility using the icons on the right of it, you can also hide/unride object using **H** / **Ctrl-H**.

Properties Editor have information of your render, scene, and active objects; if you have problens while rendering remember to check the Render configuration and that to render you need a camera, a light, and something to see and render or animated with **F12** or **Ctrl-F12**.

Blender 3D have layout (AKA workspace) for different purpose that can be view and horizontal tabs on upper part of it; it can be edited as you wish and thei will be saved along with .blend file.

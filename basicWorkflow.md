## Basic structure and Object Mode

Blender is made of various Editor and its shorcuts are based on actual status and where the mouse is resting; the 3D Vieport, Outline(upper right) and Properties(lower right) Editors are the most used ones.\
By default configuration (Right Mouse Button(RMB) and selection and **F3** for Search Tool) you can add objects on 3D Viewport by clicking on the Add Button(**Shift-A**) or searching Tool, many action can be edited by a menu or a shortcut. Also many shorcut use **Shift** to add more content and **Alt** to reverse it.\
**Ctrl-<number>**: Resolution Modifier on respecttive level\
**H** / **Ctrl-H** Hide / unhide selected object\
**/**: Local View (focus and isolate the selected object)

**G**: Grab\
**R**: Rotate\
**S**: Scale\

## Edit Mode

You can manipulate the mesh of an object in Edit mode(**Tab** on 3D Viewport) and use **1**, **2**, and **3** to select vertices, edges and faces respecfully.\
**Ctrl-R**: Loop Select\
**Ctrl-B**: Bevel\
**E**: Extrude\
**M**: Merge\
**Alt-M**: Split\
**K**: Cut

The orange dot is the origin point of a object and many action will be based on its position, its better to be at the central or base of an object.\
 **Ctrl-Alt-Shift-C**: Origin Menu

## Visibility

**Z**: Render Mode

Outline list all object on scene based on collection and change its visibility using the icons on the right of it.

## Rendering

Properties Editor have information of your render, scene, and active objects; if you have problens while rendering remember to check the Render configuration and that to render you need a camera, a light, and something to see.\
**F12**: Render\
**Ctrl-F12**: Render animation

## Workspace and saving file

Blender 3D have layout (AKA workspace) for different purpose that can be view and horizontal tabs on upper part of it; it can be edited as you wish and thei will be saved along with .blend file.\
Blender 3D makes a backup once in a while on your temporary folder and on second manual save, it add suffix "1" to the last saved file; both can be adjusted o Preferences... > Save & Load.
